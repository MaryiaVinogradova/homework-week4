# 4: Quize

## 
Target was to set up a quiz with Start page, Page of questions and options of answers (button clickk opens next question), and the end page with score and initials which stored in local storage.


I was struggling with hiding the Score page on Start page (pink box on the screenshot).

 Also, set visibility settings for each div after proceeding the quiz to hide and unhide them on each page. Please advice better way to work on it. I was thinking to set HTML files per each page, Like Welcome page, then questions page, then score page. But seems too comlicated.
 Also, I was thinking if it is better to set all divs in JS and push it into HTML but that makes code sooo long.

 Other functions are working well. 
 You will see Comment where each function starts in JS and HTML.


 P.S. Thank you so much!
