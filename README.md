# 4: Quize

## 
Target was to set up a quiz with Start page, Page of questions and options of answers (button clickk opens next question), and the end page with score and initials which stored in local storage.


What I tryed to do that hide the Score page on Start page (pink box on the screenshot) but even with hidden visibility settings this didn't work (please advice).

 ###
 Other functions are working well. 
 You will see Comment where each function starts in JS and HTML.


 P.S. Please advice how to fix the Start Page. 
 Thank you so much!
